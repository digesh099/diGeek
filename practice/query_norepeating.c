//* storing the input values ocuerence in hash table
//1. have a array having 26 elements which represents hash table
//2. calculate the hash ('a'-data) and store in the hash table
//3. if the same index is generated in the hash table increment the element at index
//
//* searchig in the hash table for occurance > 1
//1. if the input element hash index is > 1 then it is having repeating elements
//
//* have a Q for printing the non repeating element in the pipe
//1. check in th hash table wheather the entered elemt's count is <1
//- if <1 then add the element in the Q
